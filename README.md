# Airsticks-Advanced-Digital-Systems-Lab-Project
Airsticks was a project by myself (Elizabeth Boyer), Christian Tchilikov, and Dearborn Plys. It uses accelerometers, a speaker, an STM32 MCU, and a board we created. The user puts the velcro cuffs onto a pair of drum sticks and - based off of the orientation and acceleration of the sticks- can play through drumset samples.
